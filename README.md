# Distributed-Processing-Capstone
library that can be used to incorporate distributed processing into your program.

Huge project i created as my right of passage at school.  

## Client
Your program that sends data out to the server
## Server
Centralized server that handles mapping out and reducing your data to the different node workers
## NodeWorker
Program run on any computer that will pick up work from the server for processing

## When creating a task you must have
- A cs file with methods eg... [WorkPi](https://github.com/Siryu/Distributed-Processing-Capstone/blob/master/WorkFile/WorkPI.cs)
  - Map
  - Reduce
  - Distribute
 
 ### TODO:
 - remove files specific to VS
 - Better document how to use the program
